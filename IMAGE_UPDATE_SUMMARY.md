## Image Mapping Logic

The service image mapping works as follows:

1. **Keyword Matching**: Each service name is checked against a comprehensive keyword dictionary
2. **Smart Selection**: Images are selected based on keywords found in service names
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: When no keywords match, images are selected by index to ensure variety
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new service-image mappings

## Available Images

The following images are now being used:

1. `plumbing.jpeg` - For plumbing services
2. `electrician.jpeg` - For electrical services
3. `carpenter.jpeg` - For carpentry services
4. `painting.jpeg` - For painting services
5. `cleaning.jpeg` - For cleaning services
6. `mechanic.jpeg` - For mechanic services
7. `pesting.jpeg` - For pest control services
8. `gardener.jpeg` - For gardening services
9. `appliance-repair.jpeg` - For appliance repair services
10. `logo.png` - For all application logos

## Benefits

1. **Relevance**: Services are matched with appropriate, relevant images
2. **Consistency**: Same service types always get the same images across the application
3. **Performance**: Removed dependency on external theme images
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized image mapping makes future updates easier
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new service-image mappings as needed
